# Python_Mini_Projects
During my time learning Python, I have completed several mini projects to help reinforce the concepts I learned. In this readme file, I will provide an overview of some of the mini projects I completed.

## Alien Invasion Game
In this project, I created a simple 2D game using the Pygame library. The game involved a player controlling a spaceship to defeat aliens while avoiding obstacles. I implemented game mechanics such as movement controls, shooting, and collision detection.

## IP Calculator
In this project, I created an IP Calculator that can calculate subnet masks, network addresses, broadcast addresses, and IP addresses for a given network. I used the socket and struct libraries to manipulate IP addresses and implemented the subnetting algorithm to calculate the network and broadcast addresses.

## Snake Game
In this project, I created a classic Snake game using the Pygame library. The game involved a snake moving around the screen and growing in length by eating food. I implemented game mechanics such as movement controls, scoring, and collision detection.

## Pattern Matching
In this project, I created a pattern matching algorithm that finds occurrences of a pattern in a given text. I used the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to implement the pattern matching algorithm, and used Python's built-in string functions to manipulate the text.

## Conclusion
Through these mini Python projects, I gained hands-on experience in Python programming concepts such as game development, networking, algorithm design, and string manipulation. These projects were a great way to practice and reinforce the concepts I learned, and I look forward to working on more projects in the future.
